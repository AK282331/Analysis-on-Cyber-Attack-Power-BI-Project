# Cyber Attack Impact Analysis â€“ Power BI Dashboard
As we rapidly grow in AI and Automation, we're bringing powerful changes to the world â€” but also facing a rising threat: Cyber Attacks. These attacks are not just digital disruptions; they impact national economies and compromise personal privacy on a massive scale.
To highlight this growing concern, I have built an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes the global impact of cyber attacks from 2015 to 2024.

# Project Overview
This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into:
  - Financial losses caused by cyber attacks
  - Number of users impacted globally
  - Trends of cyber attacks over the years
  - Most frequent attack types
  - Industries most severely affected
  - Common defense mechanisms used
  - Most severe security vulnerabilities
  - Dataset

### The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:

In addition to the original dataset, I have created manual dimension tables to achieve normalization and reduce redundancy for better data modeling and performance.

# Key Features & Implementation
  - Explicit Measures: Created using DAX for consistent aggregation and clarity in analysis.
  - Field Parameters: Enabled users to switch between multiple measures seamlessly (e.g., Financial Losses vs. Users Affected).
  - Navigation Buttons: Designed intuitive page navigation using buttons for a smooth user experience.
  - Customized Tooltips: Context-aware tooltips provide additional insights when hovering over visuals.
  - Drill-through Functionality: Implemented to allow deeper insights into specific attack types and affected industries.
  - Clean & Responsive Design: Dashboard follows best practices in layout, color use, and interactivity for better readability and engagement.
